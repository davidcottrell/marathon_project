This memorandum is a response to your February 16, 2017, email
regarding our manuscript, ``All in the family: German twin finishing
times in the 2016 women's Olympic marathon.'' Thank you very much for
inviting us to submit a revision of our manuscript, and this
memorandum explains how we have updated it in light of comments from
you and the Chance Editorial Board.
